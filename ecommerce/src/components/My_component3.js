        The Pagani Huayra (Italian pronunciation: [ˈwaira']) is a mid-engine sports car produced by Italian sports car manufacturer Pagani, superseding the company's previous offering, the Zonda. It is named after Wayra Tata, the Quechua (indigenous South American) wind god. The Huayra was named "The Hypercar of the Year 2012" by Top Gear magazine. On 11th February 2015 it was reported that the Pagani Huayra had been sold out. The Huayra was limited to just 100 units as part of Pagani's agreement with engine supplier Mercedes-AMG.

        The Pagani Huayra was officially debuted online with several pictures in a press release on the 25th January 2011. The official world debut was at the headquarters of Pirelli in Milan in February 2011.
        The Huayra has a top speed of about 383 km/h (238 mph) and it has a 0-97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time of 2.8 seconds. Using Pirelli tyres, the Pagani Huayra is capable of 1.66 g of lateral acceleration.

        The Pagani Huayra uses a seven-speed sequential gearbox and a single disc clutch. The choice not to use a dual-clutch was due to the increase in weight of over 70 kg (154 lb), thus negating any advantage of the faster gear changes in a double-clutch transmission. As a result, the transmission weighs 96 kg (212 lb).
        The car is equipped with Brembo brake calipers, rotors and pads. The calipers have six pistons at the front and four at the rear. The rotors are drilled carbon ceramic, 380 mm (15.0 in) in diameter and 34 mm (1.3 in) thick.

        The Huayra uses a 6.0 L (5,980 cc) twin-turbocharged M158 60° V12 engine developed by Mercedes-AMG specially for the Huayra, which has a power output of 740 PS (544 kW; 730 hp) at 5,800 rpm and 1,000 N⋅m (738 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 2,250-4,500 rpm. The engine has been designed at the request of Pagani to reduce turbo lag and improve response, achieved with smaller turbochargers, a different intercooler configuration and re-programmed ECU settings.
        Like many high-performance cars, the Huayra uses dry sump lubrication. This has several key benefits including guaranteeing oil flow even when the car is subjected to extreme lateral acceleration, preventing "oil surge" which allows the engine to operate more efficiently while the lack of an oil pan allows mounting the engine lower, lowering the car's center of gravity and improving handling. The fuel consumption of the Huayra is 10 mpg‑US (23.5 L/100 km; 12.0 mpg‑imp) in city and 14 mpg‑US (16.8 L/100 km; 16.8 mpg‑imp) in highway (EPA testing).

        A water/oil heat exchanger reduces engine warm-up times on cold days and helps maintain a stable temperature for refrigerants and lubricants.

        To minimise the use of pipes and fittings (and the overall weight of the vehicle), the coolant expansion tank is mounted directly on the engine. Intercooler fins act as an expansion tank circuit at low temperatures.

        The titanium exhaust system was designed and built by MHG-Fahrzeugtechnik. Hydroformed joints were developed to reduce back pressure and ensure a free flow exhaust. Titanium reduces the weight of the exhaust system while the Inconel silencers improve reliability in the most exposed parts of the exhaust at high temperatures. The entire system weighs less than 10 kg (22 lb).
